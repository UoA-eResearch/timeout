      "Time-outs are for moments when a child’s behavior escalates beyond what they can control—like screaming, hitting, or refusing to listen. These are signs that their emotions have taken over, and they need a moment to calm down before they’re able to hear or respond to us. Time-outs provide a safe space for them to reset and regain control of their feelings. 💛\n",

      "On the flip side, when a child is upset but can still listen, express their feelings, or engage in communication, that’s actually a huge win. This is when they’re learning how to work through emotions in real time, and it’s a great opportunity for us to be there, help them process, and validate their feelings without needing a break. ✨\n",

She begins by explaining that a time-out is not a punishment but a break from a situation. She then provides two contrasting scenarios: one where a child is upset but can communicate and does not need a time-out, and another where a child is screaming and kicking and needs a break to calm down. The video includes clips of her interacting with her young children in these situations.\",\n",
      "    \"transcript\": \"There's been a lot of discussion and a lot of controversy surrounding time out and when and if they are appropriate. Now I've said it before, time out is not the punishment. It is literally just time out from the situation. We are just gonna take a break. So, I just wanna take a minute and show you a comparison of a situation where I would use time out and a situation where I don't need to use time out. Come here. Whose Spidey is this? This is Hudson's. Should we go find a toy for you to play with? No okay. Do you wanna just sit with mom for a little bit? We can go find you a toy to play with. Do you wanna come with me to find a toy or do you wanna just sit with mom for a little bit? You just wanna sit with mom for a little bit. Okay come here. See how when I'm down on his level and I'm talking to him, he's communicating back with me. He's not hurting anybody. He's not screaming at anybody. He's not yelling. He's not throwing himself around. So there's no need for him to take a break. We are already able to communicate with each other. He's already trying to talk about what is the matter with him. versus other scenarios where your toddler is yelling kicking. screaming throwing themselves around. and there's nothing that you can do to calm them down. they are not able to communicate. so therefore they would need to take some time out. and then we can talk about something. you wanna just sit with mom something. you get some toys and how do you get some toys. yes that's Spider-Man. hopefully that clarifies a little bit more when and how to use timeouts.\",\n",
